# Algorithmic-Game-Theory

## Course description: 
Broad survey of topics at the interface of theoretical computer science and economics. Introduction to auction and mechanism design, with an emphasis on computational efficiency and robustness. Introduction to the "price of anarchy", with applications to networks. Algorithms and complexity theory for learning and computing Nash and market equilibria. Case studies in Web search auctions, wireless spectrum auctions, matching markets, network routing, and security applications.

## Prerequisites: 
basic algorithms and complexity (154N and 161, or equivalent). No prior knowledge of economics or game theory is required.
